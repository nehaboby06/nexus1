# Smart Budgeting App for Homemakers & Home Entrepreneurs 🌿💼

A friendly and intelligent budgeting app designed for *homemakers and home-based entrepreneurs*.  
It helps users manage household and business finances, track income & expenses, plan budgets, and set savings goals — including *SIP & RD management* — with *Smart Financial Behavior Insights* that tell a story, not just show numbers.

##🍀Core Idea

Most budgeting apps just show numbers. This app goes beyond by providing **actionable insights**:  

- Track household and business income, expenses, and profits separately.  
- Plan monthly budgets and monitor overspending.  
- Set and track **savings goals** for household or business.  
- Manage *Systematic Investment Plans (SIP)* and *Recurring Deposits (RD)* for both household and business funds.  
- Receive **Smart Financial Behavior Insights**, showing spending trends, recurring patterns, and personalized recommendations.
