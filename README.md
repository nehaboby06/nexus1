- Plan monthly budgets and monitor overspending.  
- Set and track **savings goals** for household or business.  
- Manage *Systematic Investment Plans (SIP)* and *Recurring Deposits (RD)* for both household and business funds.  
- Receive **Smart Financial Behavior Insights**, showing spending trends, recurring patterns, and personalized recommendations.
